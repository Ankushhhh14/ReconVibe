- 🌐 Live Domain Detection with **httpx-toolkit**
- ⚠️ Subdomain Takeover check via **Subdominator**
- 📜 URL Harvesting from:
  - **gau**
  - **waybackurls**
  - **katana**
  - **waymore** (optional)
- 🎯 Vulnerability Pattern Detection using **gf**
- 📁 Organized outputs by folder name

## 🧪 Usage

```bash
chmod +x reconvibe.sh
./reconvibe.sh <domain.com OR domains.txt>
```

You'll be prompted to enter a name for the output folder. The script then automatically performs recon and saves all output in that folder.

---

## 📂 Output Structure

- `subfinder.txt` – All discovered subdomains
- `live.txt` – Filtered live hosts
- `subdominator.txt` – Subdomain takeover findings
- `gau.txt`, `waybackurls.txt`, `katana.txt`, `waymore.txt` – Raw URL output from various tools
- `urls.txt` – Deduplicated final URL list
- `*_urls.txt` – URLs matching specific **gf** patterns

---

## ⚡ GF Patterns Included

- `xss`
- `sqli`
- `ssti`
- `idor`
- `lfi`
- `rce`
- `ssrf`
- `redirect`
- `s3`
- `debug_logic`
- `interestingEXT`
- `interestingparams`
- `php_errors`
- `server-errors`
- `cors`

## 🛠 Common Issues & Fixes


### ❗ Problem: Line Endings Error


#### Error Output:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/ReconVibe]
└─$ bash reconvibe.sh
reconvibe.sh: line 2: $'
': command not found
reconvibe.sh: line 4: syntax error near unexpected token $'{
''
'econvibe.sh: line 4: handle_line_endings() {
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/ReconVibe]
└─$
```

---

#### Cause:

This issue occurs when the script uses **Windows-style line endings (CRLF)**, which are incompatible with Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS/WSL).  
The presence of the carriage return (`
`) character causes the script to fail during execution.

---

#### Solution:

Here’s how you can fix it:

1. **Convert to Unix line endings (recommended):**

   If you have the `dos2unix` utility installed, run:

   ```bash
   dos2unix reconvibe.sh
   ```

2. **Or manually remove carriage returns:**

   If `dos2unix` is not available, you can use `sed`:

   ```bash
   sed -i 's/\r//g' reconvibe.sh

   ```

3. **Ensure the script is executable:**

   After fixing the line endings, grant execute permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x reconvibe.sh
   ```

4. **Run the script again:**

   ```bash
   ./reconvibe.sh <domain.com>
   ```

✅ _Tip: Always use a Unix-compatible text editor (like VSCode with LF line endings) when editing shell scripts to avoid this issue._
